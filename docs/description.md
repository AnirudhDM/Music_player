# Music Player — Rebuild Task

## Your Starting Point

You've been given a partially scaffolded React project. The following files are already in place and **cannot be modified**:

- `index.html` — app entry point
- `src/main.jsx` — React root mount
- `vite.config.js` — build config
- `package.json` — dependencies (already installed)
- `eslint.config.js` — linting rules
- `public/songs/` — 5 audio tracks (`.wav`)
- `src/assets/images/` — 5 cover art images

Everything inside `src/` (except `main.jsx`) is yours to create.

## The Task

A fully working version of this application is running in the preview panel.

**Start there.** Click around. Play with it. Figure out what it does, how it behaves, and what it feels like to use.

Once you have a feel for the product, use an AI agent to help you form a plan — then implement it. Build the entire application from scratch inside the `src/` directory to match what you see in the preview as closely as possible.

There are no instructions beyond this. The preview is your description.
